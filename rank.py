"""Roster-aware draft board for this league, with an optimal-drafter draft simulation.

    uv run rank.py                         # pool + draft + source artifacts -> rankings.json
    uv run rank.py --report                # + board, convergence and recommendation on stderr
    uv run rank.py --no-draft              # ignore the live board, rank the whole pool
    uv run rank.py --selftest              # verify solver, opponents, and board loader

Scope is this league and nothing else; the league constants and strategy knobs live in
ranker/league.py. The value input is `pool.json`'s projection distribution — `points`
(GridironAI's median one-season projection in this league's 0.5 PPR scoring) with
`points_low`/`points_high`, the provider's calibrated 10th/90th-percentile outcomes
(see ranker/pool.py for why the provider's 3D value is deliberately unused). A first
converge pass on the raw medians measures the projected post-draft wire, and every
player is then repriced at the wire plus his truncated expected value above it
(`ranker/value.reprice_with_uncertainty`) — the scalar the rest of the run drafts off,
so early picks are priced near their median and late picks by their ceiling, with no
round heuristic. The method, in one breath: what the waiver wire holds
after the draft is an *outcome* of how the league drafts, so wire levels are measured
from the converged draft and feed valuation, while my roster is valued as expected
optimal lineup points under position-wide availability with one unique waiver fallback
per position (`ranker/value.py`). `draft.json` — the live board — is the
simulation's starting state, not a filter (ranker/board.py). Only my slot uses the
projection-based roster objective. Every opponent uses the external provider board most
associated with its prior picks, loaded from the data-source investigator; unfilled
dedicated starters softly adjust that order, and its observed adherence controls Monte
Carlo choice noise. A compounding soft-depth preference keeps opponents' late roster
shapes plausible, and Sleeper's per-position roster caps bind every team. My slot's
choices contain no other positional roster-size heuristic.

The board's headline `lineup_gain` is the decision metric itself: the player's marginal
expected-lineup value on my current roster at the converged wire levels, so it shrinks
at positions my roster already covers. The `my_next_picks` block is the direct answer to
"who should I draft next" — on top of that same gain it prices opponent demand and what
my following picks keep. Its first decision searches target plans across my next four
held picks, then plays each first-candidate plan out to the end of the draft
(`ranker/planning.py`). Rank columns are renumbered over the undrafted
players actually emitted.

Python stdlib only. Deterministic: every tie breaks on player_id and the RNG is seeded.
