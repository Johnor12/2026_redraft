"""Run the data build: projections.html -> projections.json -> pool.json (+ sleeper ids + points).

Four stages, in order:

    1. parse_projections.py      html  -> json   full provider export, 900 players, 8 schemes
    2. build_pool.py             json  -> json   this league's pool, one value column
    3. match_sleeper.py          pool.json       adds each player's Sleeper id, in place
    4. apply_gridiron_points.py  pool.json       re-prices points (+ low/high quantiles)
                                                 from the GridironAI CSV export

Everything the build reads and every intermediate it writes lives in this folder;
the one file it publishes is ``pool.json`` at the repo root, which is what
``rank.py`` consumes.

Stage 1 is the faithful record of what the provider published and is never narrowed;
stage 2 is the narrow, draft-ready view. Keeping them separate is what makes stage 2
re-runnable (different rank limit, different scoring) without re-parsing 8 MB of html,
and what leaves the dropped columns recoverable. Stage 3 has to follow stage 2 because
stage 2 rewrites pool.json from scratch, dropping the ids stage 3 adds. Stage 4 joins
by name against the GridironAI export, so it can run any time after stage 2; it stays
last so a rebuild ends priced.

**Stages 3 and 4 never download.** Stage 3 joins against a cached copy of Sleeper's
~14 MB player dump, pulled by hand with ``fetch_sleeper.py`` — Sleeper asks for at most
one call a day, and a roster of NFL players is not something a rebuild of local
projections needs to re-ask for. With no dump present the stage warns and is skipped;
the ids only link the pool to the live draft, so a rebuild still prices. Running
``--only sleeper`` makes the missing dump an error instead, since there the dump is
the whole point of the run. Stage 4 reads the newest hand-saved
``data/gridironai-rankings-*.csv`` (exported with this league's scoring selected).
``data/sleeper_projections.json`` no longer prices the pool: ``fetch_sleeper_projections.py``
is kept because the investigator reads that file as the Sleeper ADP opponent board.

All scripts remain usable as standalone CLIs — this only fixes the order and stops
on the first failure.

Ranking (`rank.py`) is deliberately not a stage here: it consumes pool.json, takes a
simulation seed and strategy knobs, and is re-run far more often than the data is rebuilt.

Usage:
    uv run pool_pipeline/pipeline.py                      # html -> projections.json -> pool.json
    uv run pool_pipeline/pipeline.py --report             # + every stage's validation summary
    uv run pool_pipeline/pipeline.py --only pool          # single stage
    uv run pool_pipeline/pipeline.py --only sleeper       # re-join ids onto an existing pool.json
    uv run pool_pipeline/pipeline.py --only points        # re-price an existing pool.json
    uv run pool_pipeline/fetch_sleeper.py                 # refresh the Sleeper dump (manual)
    uv run pool_pipeline/fetch_sleeper_projections.py     # refresh Sleeper projections (manual)
