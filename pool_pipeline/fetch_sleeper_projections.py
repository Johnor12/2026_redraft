"""Capture Sleeper's season projections and ADP. **Manual step — not a pipeline stage.**

    uv run pool_pipeline/fetch_sleeper_projections.py

The league players page (sleeper.com/leagues/<id>/players) is backed by a public
projections endpoint — no login required. It serves Rotowire's full-season stat
projections plus ADP for every player. The points shown on the page are *not* the
endpoint's precomputed ``pts_half_ppr`` (that assumes Sleeper's default scoring,
e.g. -1 per pass INT where this league uses -2); the page scores the raw stat
projections with the league's own ``scoring_settings``. This script does the same
dot product, which reproduces the page's numbers exactly.

Writes ``data/sleeper_projections.json``: the top 250 players by projected points
across QB/RB/WR/TE/DEF (the page's sort), each with ``sleeper_id``, ``name``,
``position``, ``team``, ``points`` (league scoring), and ``adp`` (half-PPR
redraft, the league's format; 999.0 is Sleeper's "undrafted" sentinel).

The file no longer prices ``pool.json`` (GridironAI does, stage 4); it is kept
because the data-source investigator reads it as the Sleeper ADP opponent board.
