"""Where every file in the pool build lives.

This pipeline is a folder of scripts with one published artifact: ``pool.json`` at
the repo root, which is what the ranker (``rank.py``) reads. Everything else —
the 8 MB provider html, the 2.5 MB faithful parse of it, the 14 MB Sleeper dump — is
working material and stays inside ``pool_pipeline/data/``.

``draft_pipeline/`` is the other pipeline in this repo and keeps its own copy of this
file. The two share no code and no working files; they meet only at ``sleeper_id``,
the key ``match_sleeper.py`` writes into every pool player.

Paths are anchored to this file, not to the current directory, so every stage can
be run from anywhere:

    uv run pool_pipeline/pipeline.py
    cd pool_pipeline && uv run build_pool.py

Both write the same ``pool.json``. Every script still takes explicit paths on the
command line; these are only the defaults.
