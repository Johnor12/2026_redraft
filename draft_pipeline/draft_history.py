"""Parse a hand-pasted ESPN draft-room page into made picks.

ESPN's league read API does not surface live-draft picks while the draft runs (a pick
made in the room stayed invisible to `mDraftDetail` for minutes in testing, and may
only sync when the draft completes), so on draft day the draft room is copied into
``draft_history.txt`` at the repo root. This module turns that paste into the made-pick
shapes ``fetch_draft.py`` builds from the API, and
``fetch_draft.py`` overlays them on the board it already fetched — ESPN-reported picks
win wherever both exist.

The paste may be the whole draft room (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C) or just its pick-history table.
In a full-page paste the table is bounded by ``Pick History`` / ``All Rounds`` and
the activity feed — its ``Activity`` header, or its ``Picks`` tab in rooms (mock
drafts, at least) that omit the header. Each round starts with a ``Round N`` line, and each pick contributes, in
order: its overall pick number (the displayed Pick column counts across rounds; the
``Round N`` header and league size only cross-check it), the player's name, an
injury designation (``Q``, ``O``, ...) if the player carries one, NFL team, and
position, then a tail of columns (fantasy team, points, rank) this parser never
reads. Records are anchored on the position line — the NFL team sits directly above
it, then an optional status token, then name and pick number — so junk in the tail
cannot break the parse, and a malformed record raises instead of being skipped: it
is a mis-paste to fix.

Players are matched to the pool pipeline's cached Sleeper dump by normalized name,
position always required to agree and team used as a tiebreaker — a trimmed copy of
``pool_pipeline/match_sleeper.py``'s tiers 1 and 2 (the pipelines deliberately share
no code, and the paste has no age or alternate spelling for the last-name tier to
lean on). D/ST picks skip name matching: Sleeper keys team defenses by abbreviation.

Usage:
    uv run draft_pipeline/draft_history.py --teams 4      # parse + match draft_history.txt
    uv run draft_pipeline/draft_history.py --teams 4 some_paste.txt
    uv run draft_pipeline/draft_history.py --selftest
