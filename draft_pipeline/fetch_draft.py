"""Fetch the ESPN league's live draft and publish the complete made-and-pending board.

This is a network-only, on-demand pipeline. Board geometry and the output contract live
in `draft_board.py`; this entry point fetches ESPN's undocumented v3 league API and
adapts its response into the shapes `draft_board.py` consumes, so `draft.json` keeps
the exact contract the ranker already reads.

One request does everything: the league endpoint with the `mDraftDetail` (picks),
`mSettings` (draft order and roster shape) and `mTeam` (teams and members) views.
ESPN identifies players by its own ids; picks are joined back to `pool.json`'s
`sleeper_id` through the Sleeper player dump the pool pipeline already caches, which
carries `espn_id` for every fantasy-relevant player. D/ST picks use ESPN's fixed
`-16000 - proTeamId` id form and Sleeper's team-abbreviation DEF ids.

The read API lags the live draft (a made pick stays `playerId` -1 for minutes, maybe
until the draft completes), so during a draft the room's pick history is hand-pasted
into `draft_history.txt` at the repo root; when that file has content, its picks are
parsed by `draft_history.py` and overlaid on the fetched board, ESPN-reported picks
winning.

Assumptions, stated instead of defended: the league drafts a plain snake (ESPN has no
third-round reversal), picks are never traded (ESPN live drafts do not support it, so
`traded_picks` is always empty), and the auth cookies below are current — ESPN answers
a private league with cookies from any logged-in browser session.
