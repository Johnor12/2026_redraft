# Data-source investigator

This process snapshots common redraft boards, normalizes player identity, and asks which
board best explains each drafter's picks. It evaluates every selection at the moment it
was made: drafted players above it are removed before its availability rank is measured.

```bash
uv run data_source_investigator/pipeline.py --report
uv run data_source_investigator/pipeline.py --only investigate  # reuse the snapshots
uv run data_source_investigator/investigate.py --selftest
uv run evaluate_opponents.py  # forward replay, 100 prediction draws per opponent pick
uv run refresh.py --report  # refresh the draft, ranking board, and evaluation only
uv run serve.py  # open http://127.0.0.1:8123/data_source_investigator/
```

The built-in comparisons are FantasyCalc redraft (10-team, 1 QB, 0.5 PPR), KeepTradeCut's
redraft 1QB board, FantasyFootballCalculator's 10-team half-PPR mock-draft ADP,
FantasyPros half-PPR ECR, ESPN's live-draft ADP across all ESPN leagues, the DraftSharks
1QB ADP already in `pool.json`, Sleeper's half-PPR ADP from
`pool_pipeline/data/sleeper_projections.json`, and a derived
consensus board averaging each pool player's rank across every other source (manual
boards included). The consensus board is also the ranker's opponent fallback: it
models opponents before they have picked and completes each provider's uncovered tail.
Provider formats are not identical; `data/rankings.json` and the final report retain the
exact format for each source. Raw web responses stay in `data/raw/`, so parsing can be
repeated without replacing the snapshot.

Implementation context is separated by concern: `fetch_rankings.py` owns network
snapshots, `providers.py` owns provider-specific formats, `identity.py` owns canonical
player resolution, `build_rankings.py` assembles normalized boards, and `investigate.py`
scores those boards against the draft.

`data_source_matches.json` is the published report. For each drafter it includes the
closest and second-closest source, a separation-based confidence label, every provider's
score, and pick-level evidence showing the higher-ranked available players they passed.
The label is an inference, not proof: rankings are correlated, roster construction and
personal preferences cause intentional deviations, and a current ranking snapshot may
have changed since an earlier draft pick.

The ranker consumes the closest source as each opponent's player order and
`mean_log2_loss` as that manager's adherence estimate. Personal and opponent strategies
remain separate: the opponent picker never translates the source order into personal
projections or board value. It checks that the report's draft id and ranking-snapshot timestamp
match its other inputs, so `refresh.py` always runs this investigation after fetching the
draft and before simulating the remaining picks.

`index.html` visualizes that report in two connected views: a league-wide team/source
fit heatmap and a selected team's pick/source availability matrix. Selecting any matrix
cell shows the provider's overall rank, the player's rank among those still available,
and up to five higher-ranked players the team passed.

Provider identities join by Sleeper id first and normalized name second. When a source
lacks the id, a final conservative tier accepts first-name abbreviations only when the
first names are prefixes and last name, team, and position all agree (`Cam Ward` to
`Cameron Ward`). It intentionally does not make last-name-only guesses such as matching
Tahj Washington to Malik Washington.

## Manual sources

For a paid, login-only, or user-exported provider, place one CSV in `data/manual/` and run
the build and investigate stages. The filename becomes the source id (for example,
`destination_devy.csv` becomes `destination_devy`). Required columns are:

```csv
rank,name,position
1,Josh Allen,QB
2,Bijan Robinson,RB
```

Optional columns are `team,sleeper_id,value`. Names are joined to `pool.json` by normalized
name and position when `sleeper_id` is absent. A manual board must contain at least 50
unique QB/RB/WR/TE rows. Raw and manual inputs are ignored by git by default.
