# Ranker

`rank.py` consumes `pool.json`, `draft.json`, normalized provider boards, and
`data_source_matches.json`, then publishes `rankings.json`.

```bash
uv run rank.py
uv run rank.py --report
uv run rank.py --no-draft
uv run rank.py --draft other.json
uv run rank.py --selftest
```

A live board is the simulation's starting state, not a post-processing filter. Made picks
remain on their rosters, only pending picks are played, and output ranking rows contain
undrafted players only.

## Modules

- `league.py`: league shape and hardcoded strategy constants
- `pool.py`: pool document to `Player` objects
- `board.py`: live `draft.json` to the immutable starting state
- `opponents.py`: inferred provider boards to complete opponent strategies
- `value.py`: expected lineup value and wire measurement
- `simulation.py`: one deterministic draft state and pick policies
- `convergence.py`: wire-level fixed point
- `planning.py`: Monte Carlo availability, candidate survival, lookahead, and rollouts
- `rankings.py`: ranking rows and serialized next-pick recommendations
- `output.py`: top-level `rankings.json` payload
- `report.py`: human-readable stderr diagnostics
- `validate.py`: every-run output and league invariants
- `selftest.py`: solver, opponent-separation, planning, and malformed-board checks

## Value model

The value input is GridironAI's projection distribution: pool.json's `points` (the
median season projection) with `points_low`/`points_high`, the calibrated 10th/90th-
percentile outcomes. A first converge pass on the raw medians measures the projected
post-draft wire, and `value.reprice_with_uncertainty` then reprices every player at
the wire plus his truncated expected value above it (Swanson's 0.3/0.4/0.3 over the
three quantiles): a season outcome below the wire is worth the wire, because the bust
gets cut and the spot streams free agents. Everything downstream drafts off that one
repriced scalar, so early picks price near their projection mean while late picks are
priced almost entirely by their ceiling — the draft-upside-late behaviour falls out of
the objective instead of being a round heuristic. A player with null quantiles (a
Sleeper-fallback row, priced by a scale-calibrated Sleeper median) collapses to a
point mass at his median and reprices to max(wire, median). The second converge pass
and every reported value below are denominated in repriced points.

The board is ranked by `lineup_gain`, each player's marginal expected-lineup value on
my current roster at the converged wire levels.

The final waiver bodies affect my expected-lineup choices, and those choices affect who
remains undrafted. This creates a fixed point:

```text
wire levels -> expected lineup value -> simulated draft -> wire levels
```

The map is discrete and can alternate between neighboring league shapes, so convergence
detects a repeated state and averages levels over that cycle. The expected-lineup solver
values the weekly re-optimized lineup: the starter composition is re-chosen per
availability draw, so a flex seat vacated at one position is refilled by the best
remaining body at any flex position. It is exact and closed-form — dedicated slots via a
per-position Bernoulli cascade ordered by points when active, the two FLEX seats via
layer-cake integrals of the pooled RB/WR/TE marginal count (a QB can never take a flex
seat) — and `--selftest` checks it against brute-force enumeration of every
availability subset. One always-available waiver body can fill one job at each position;
it is not an unlimited scalar. Expectation-of-max keeps value monotone when a projection
improves or a player is added.

## Opponents and planning

Personal and opponent strategies are intentionally separate. My slot alone uses
projections and expected-lineup roster value. Each opponent uses the provider board
closest to its completed picks, with a soft boost for unfilled dedicated starters and a
compounding source-rank penalty for adding players beyond comfortable positional depth
(3rd QB/TE, 7th RB/WR). These are preferences, not draft limits: a large enough
source-rank gap can still justify another player at a deep position. The hard limits
are Sleeper's position caps (`MAX_POSITIONS`), which bind every roster, mine included.
Observed `mean_log2_loss` calibrates randomness around that preference, after shrinking
toward the cold-start prior as if that prior had been observed on two extra picks — one
or two on-board picks otherwise fit a near-deterministic policy.
`OPPONENT_POSITION_TILT` is empty until this league's own draft supplies replay
evidence (`evaluate_opponents.py`); the previous league's RB tilt was fitted to its
draft, not this one. Missing provider
players are appended in consensus-average order (the investigator's `consensus`
source, which also models opponents with no observed picks); opponents never fall
back to my board.

My simulated pick policy does not use those targets or any other positional roster-size
heuristic beyond the caps. Positional depth is priced only by projected expected-lineup
value, so a roster shape that differs from the opponents' conventional behavior can be a
source of value.

The bulk deterministic policy scores value now plus the expected best option at its next
pick. The live shortlist starts from the current board before intervening opponents pick,
then removes candidates below 5% survival to my turn. Candidate branches are evaluated
conditional on reaching that turn. Four-pick planning applies the same 5% floor to each
later target's conditional survival before playing finalists to the end of the draft.
The first `take` is the EV recommendation if available; when the noiseless example has
already removed it, `deterministic_fallback` identifies the example draft's legal choice.
Worker processes receive immutable inputs once, and seeded task ids keep results
deterministic across scheduling. Planning uses at most eight workers so a rerank does not
saturate every host CPU; this changes elapsed time, not the simulations or their output.

## Output contract

`rankings.json.rankings` is ranked by the roster-aware `lineup_gain` decision metric and
contains projected and simulated pick fields, opponent consensus deltas, and
availability estimates for each undrafted player.
`my_next_picks` is the full recommendation and can intentionally disagree with the
static board order. `example_draft` contains structured final-roster records for dashboard
lineup comparison. `validation.problems` is empty on success; any problem makes the CLI
exit nonzero.
