"""Expected lineup points and wire-level measurement.

A roster is valued as the expectation, over position-wide Bernoulli availability, of the
best legal lineup each week: the composition is re-chosen per availability draw, so a
flex job vacated by an unavailable RB can be refilled by the best remaining body at any
flex position (expectation-of-max, not max-of-expectations — the latter overvalues depth
behind many locked slots).

The weekly optimum decomposes exactly: each position fills its dedicated slots with its
best available bodies, then the FLEX seats go to the best pooled RB/WR/TE leftovers.
The QB slot is dedicated only — no flex seat can take a second QB. With F flex seats:
    dedicated tops  +  top-F pooled non-QB marginals.
Each expectation is computed in closed form: the dedicated term by a small Bernoulli
cascade per position, the pooled term by a layer-cake integral of the marginal-count
distribution over value thresholds (positions are independent, so the pooled count is a
tiny convolution). The best waiver player at each position is inserted once as an
always-available body, so one free agent can fill one lineup job, never several
simultaneous holes.

This is one objective with one set of units: expected lineup points. There is no role
threshold and no separate bench bonus. A better projection can retain every role a worse
projection could fill, which makes roster value monotone when a player improves, is
replaced by a better same-position player, or is simply added.
