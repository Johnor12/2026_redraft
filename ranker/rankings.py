    """One row per *undrafted* player: the board is a list of decisions still to make.

    Drafted players are dropped rather than flagged — they cannot be picked, and leaving
    them in would put a name at rank 1 that is not available. Their points still shape the
    converged wire levels every row's lineup gain is measured with, which happens in
    `converge`. All rank columns are renumbered over what is emitted, so they read as
    positions on the remaining board rather than as gapped survivors of the preseason one.

    Two simulations are reported per player, and they answer different questions:
      * `sim_pick` is from the single deterministic draft, no noise.
      * `sim_adp` / `p_drafted` / `p_available_at_my_picks` come from the noisy redraws
        (adherence-calibrated draws over their provider ranks) and measure the other nine
        teams' demand only. My own simulated picks are this policy's behaviour, not market
        pressure — counting them as takes reported the model's own favourite stashes as
        scarce — but a redraw where I took him early also observes no opponent demand
        afterwards, so availability is a Kaplan-Meier estimate: an opponent take is the
        event, my own take censors the redraw. Under deterministic play availability is
        0 or 1, which tells you nothing about risk, so the noise band is what makes the
        columns usable at the table. It is also where uncertainty in the inferred source
        policies belongs.

    """The model's recommendation plus the deterministic draft's fallback path.

    This is the question the whole script exists to answer, so it is surfaced rather than
    left implicit in `sim_pick`. The candidates carry the two parts of the decision score:
    what the player adds to my expected lineup now, and the expected value of the best
    player still there at my following pick if I take him. Positional depth enters only
    through projected expected-lineup value, never through a roster-size heuristic.

    At my first pending pick, `next_pick_ev` comes from short branch-specific opponent
    redraws conditioned on the candidate reaching that turn rather than the global-rank
    survival shortcut used by the bulk draft policy.
    That pick additionally carries a four-pick target plan and full-horizon rollout:
    `rollout_ev` is the mean final value of my whole roster if I take the candidate and
    the rest of the draft plays out, `rollout_edge` is his paired advantage over the
    ordinary policy on the same conditioned path, and `rollout_se` is its standard error.
    Every candidate carries a measured edge, the two-pick leader included, so `rollout_ev`
    ranks them directly. The first `take` is the rollout's conditional recommendation. If
    the deterministic example removes it before my turn, `deterministic_fallback` records
    what that path takes instead. A rollout can overrule the two-pick leader only by
    beating his plan by more than the playout noise between them.

    Its candidates also carry `p_available_if_i_pass` (planning.candidate_survival): across
    redraws where my slot is banned from ever taking him, the share where no opponent
    has taken him before each of my picks — the honest "how long can I wait on him".
    Unlike the Kaplan-Meier `p_available_at_my_picks`, it needs no independence
    assumption: the redraws actually play the pass-on-him counterfactual out.
