"""This league's shape (from README.md) and the strategy constants.

10 teams, 0.5 PPR redraft, 1 QB. Starters are 1 QB / 2 RB / 2 WR / 1 TE /
2 W-R-T = 8, plus 1 D/ST the offense-only model does not price. Then 4 bench
= 13 draftable roster spots = 13 rounds = 130 picks. The 1 IR spot is not
drafted into. Plain snake, no reversal.

The geometry (teams, rounds, my slot, and everything derived from them) is a default:
draft.json is authoritative, and `configure_from_draft()` rebinds it before any board
is built, so test drafts with other league and roster sizes work unchanged. The
starting-lineup shape and the strategy knobs are this league's and stay fixed —
draft.json carries no lineup information.
